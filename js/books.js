Introduction</b></p><p><br>Obviously the stakes are much higher when your client is facing a felony DUII charge. In these cases, your client has much more at risk, including the potential for prison time, a lifetime driver’s license revocation, and being labeled a “Felon.” Before representing someone facing this criminal charge, familiarize yourself with the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission’s Sentencing Guidelines Rules and consult experienced practitioners who have tried these cases before. The facts, aside from the prior convictions, will be like every other misdemeanor DUII case you have defended before. Do not let the label of “felony DUII” deter you from the case. There are many ways to effectively defend and attack felony DUII cases. Some of the methods are listed below. </p><p><br><b>II. The Crimes</b></p><p><br><b>A. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors813.html">ORS 813.010</a> (5)(a) (Three Prior Convictions) (House Bill 2002)</b></p><p><br>Created in 1999, the Oregon Legislature established the crime of felony DUII. When HB 2002 passed, it created subsection 813.010 (5) which states:</p><p><br>“Driving while under the influence of intoxicants is a class C felony if the defendant has been convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of this section or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction at least three times in the 10 years prior to the date of the current offense and the current offense was committed in a motor vehicle. For purposes of this subsection, a prior conviction for boating while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors830.html">ORS 830.325</a> or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction, or for prohibited operation of an aircraft in violation of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors837.html">ORS 837.080(1)(a)</a> or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction, shall be considered a prior conviction of driving while under the influence of intoxicants.”</p><p><br>Next, in 2007 the legislature completely reorganized the statute and included “controlled substances, inhalants or any combination thereof” as part of the crime and moved to exclude convictions for minors where the conviction was based on their BAC being below the normal permissible limit for their jurisdiction (which is not a crime in Oregon as impairment must still be shown):</p><p><br>“(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, a conviction for a driving offense in another jurisdiction based solely on a person under 21 years of age having a blood alcohol content that is lower than the permissible blood alcohol content in that jurisdiction for a person 21 years of age or older does not constitute a prior conviction.”</p><p><br>Finally, in 2009 the legislature put language back into the crime for defendants who have “been convicted of, or been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for an act that if committed by an adult would be [a DUII].” This language allows some juvenile adjudications to be counted as a prior conviction. </p><p><br><b>Note:</b> It has become the practice of many district attorneys offices in Oregon that for persons ages 15, 16 and 17 who commit traffic misdemeanor offenses (e.g., DUII’s, Reckless Driving), the case is remanded to adult/circuit court for prosecution and the juvenile court system is bypassed entirely.</p><p><b>B. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors813.html">ORS 813.011</a> (Two Prior Convictions) (Ballot Measure 73)</b></p><p><br>In 2011 the Oregon Legislature made a major change to felony DUII cases and created ORS 813.011. The statute reads as follows: </p><p><br>(1) Driving under the influence of intoxicants under ORS 813.010 (Driving under the influence of intoxicants) shall be a Class C felony if the defendant has been convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 (Driving under the influence of intoxicants), or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction, at least two times in the 10 years prior to the date of the current offense.</p><p>(2) Once a person has been sentenced for a Class C felony under this section, the 10-year time limitation is eliminated and any subsequent episode of driving under the influence of intoxicants shall be a Class C felony regardless of the amount of time which intervenes.</p><p>(3) Upon conviction for a Class C felony under this section, the person shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of incarceration of 90 days, without reduction for any reason.</p><p><b>C. Differences between ORS 813.010 (5) and 813.011</b></p><p><br>Most obviously; ORS 813.010 (5) requires three prior convictions when ORS 813.011 only requires two prior convictions. </p><p><br>ORS 813.010 (5) requires that the current crime be a motor vehicle (defined in ORS 801.360) whereas ORS 813.011 being similar to the rest of the DUII statutes only requires a vehicle (ORS 801.590). However, under either statute the prior conviction crimes can include Boating Under the Influence, Pedaling Under the Influence or other variations as a prior conviction in Oregon or another jurisdiction. </p><p><b>III. Pretrial</b></p><p><br><b>A. Challenging Prior Convictions</b></p><p>One of the most important things counsel can do for a felony DUII defendant is to exclude, suppress, or otherwise nullify the prior conviction so those priors are no longer an element of the felony DUII. For purposes of the current DUII charge being a felony, the prior convictions are measured from the date of <i>conviction</i> of the priors to the date of <i>incident</i> on the current charge. </p><p><br><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors136.html">ORS 136.434</a> and ORS 813.328 are the two guidelines. Counsel should familiarize themselves with these statutes and the subsequent case law before moving forward.</p><p><br><b>Note</b>: ORS 813.328 (1) A defendant who challenges the validity of prior convictions alleged by the state as an element of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants must give notice of the intent to challenge the validity of the prior convictions at least<b> seven days prior to the first date set for trial </b>on the felony charge. [See Appendix A] (First Date = First Trial Setting).</p><p><br><b>1. Validity of a Prior Conviction</b></p><p>To be used as an element of the crime of DUII, each prior conviction must meet the Oregon standard for a valid conviction. Although uncounseled pleas are becoming far less frequent, they still occur.

Courts have been notoriously broad when interpreting a “statutory counterpart” to Oregon’s ORS 813.010. The counterpart requirement is met if the crimes are “remarkably similar or have same use, role or characteristics.” <i>Mersman</i>, supra. This would typically exclude convictions for “wet reckless” or other such crimes. </p><p><br><b>3. Other Considerations</b></p><p><br>Violations, as opposed to crime’s should not be considered convictions for purposes of felony DUII elements as they do not fit the “statutory counterpart” of the DUII in Oregon, nor the preponderance standard inherent in any violation. </p><p><br><b>B. Negotiating a Misdemeanor</b></p><p><br>Pursuant to ORS 813.170, the defendant may not plead guilty to another offense when they are charged with DUII. What this statute does <i>not</i> say is that a defendant may not plea to a misdemeanor DUII when they have been charged with a felony DUII. Some of the factors that prosecutors will look for include age of the prior convictions, relative criminal history, success in treatment, high risk driver’s courses, etc. Although it can be very difficult, use all these positive factors to help negotiate the misdemeanor DUII. </p><p><br><b>IV. Trial</b></p><p><br>The elements of a felony DUII trial will be identical to the elements in a misdemeanor DUII trial. The state will still be required to prove the same elements with one additional requirement, the prior convictions. If counsel is unable to exclude, suppress, or otherwise nullify the prior conviction, be prepared to either stipulate or face their existence head-on with the jury. </p><p><br><b>A. To Stipulate or Not to Stipulate</b></p><p>If the defendant does not stipulate to the existence of prior convictions pursuant to ORS 813.326 (3), the prosecutor will be required to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. The most common way is via certified copies of the judgment presented to the jury pursuant to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.510">OEC 902</a>. These judgments will be admitted and allowed for the jury to consider. With prior convictions admitted and under consideration by the jury, the defense of your case just became far more difficult. </p><p><br>The best course of action for a Felony DUII is to stipulate to the prior convictions under ORS 813.326 (3), thereby excluding this evidence from the consideration of the jury. There will still be a twelve member jury empaneled, however the jury will not be advised that this is a felony case, nor will they be advised of the prior convictions unless and until a guilty verdict is reached. If the defendant has stipulated to the priors and is convicted by the jury, arguments that can be made regarding the validity of those prior convictions are limited at that point. </p><p><br><b>Note:</b> All arguments regarding pretrial admissibility and validity of the prior convictions should have already been litigated, but objection (outside the presence of the jury) should be made for purposes of appeal (see Section III). Look at any documents carefully – only a final judgment of conviction is sufficient to prove the existence of the prior beyond a reasonable doubt. Beware of certified copies of dockets, summary letters from clerks of court, plea petitions, charging documents and other documents that are not final judgments of conviction<i>.</i></p><p><br><b>V.

The Prosecution’s Case</b></p><p><br><b>A. The Goal of the Prosecution</b> </p><p><br>1. Driving under the influence cases are fairly straightforward to prepare and present. The state’s case must be based on logic and reason. If the case theory is not logical, it clearly will not rise to beyond a reasonable doubt. </p><p><br>2. The goal for the prosecution is to build a trusting relationship with the jury during jury selection and not overpromise facts that cannot be delivered during opening statement. The same is true for defense attorneys. However, for prosecutors, during the trial the focus should be on the witnesses. In my opinion, the best prosecutor directs the case but is unnoticed by the jury during his or her case in chief. The reasoning is simple: the jurors are going to figure out the prosecutor wasn’t there when the defendant was driving, pulled over, performing tests, back at the police station or hospital or for any part of the interviewing/investigating stage. Any attention placed on the prosecutor is a lost opportunity for focus on the witnesses. At the end of the case, the jury should be basing the verdict on the evidence. And the witnesses and exhibits provide the evidence. </p><p><br><b>B.

Field Sobriety Tests</b></p><p><br>Field sobriety tests as a component of BUII cases are often overlooked by both the police and defense attorneys. The National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA), in a successful grant application to the U.S. Coast Guard, noted the following:</p><p><br>A battery of SFSTs was validated for traffic enforcement over two decades ago and since has become accepted nationwide as a means of demonstrating probable cause to arrest suspected impaired drivers. However, no such definitive validation has ever been conducted for SFSTs used on suspected impaired boat operators. In fact, the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) field sobriety test is the only truly validated SFST that can be administered to BUI suspects by marine law enforcement officer while afloat. </p><p><br>Despite the lack of validation, many marine enforcement agencies routinely teach their officers to use these same highway-based SFSTs to screen boat operators, a purpose for which they were not validated. Over the course of the last 20 years literally thousands of BUI cases have been prosecuted using SFSTs designed and validated for use on highways, but borrowed as proxies for use on our waterways. Unfortunately, the primary battery of SFSTs approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA) for use in highway traffic enforcement is based on the assessment of human motor skills linked to one’s sense of balance.</p><p><br>The grant application is full of excellent information that illustrates the weaknesses in BUII prosecutions, especially with regard to the administration of field sobriety tests. NASBLA’s application recounts the history of studies conducted concerning field sobriety tests in a marine environment, concluding with a description of the research to date:</p><p><br>In 1993, Dr. Marceline Burns (“A Study of Field Sobriety Tests in the Marine Environment”), of the Southern California Research Institute, conducted a preliminary study in an attempt to evaluate a number of accepted field sobriety tests and their use in a marine environment. The results of this study indicated the Rhomberg-type tests of subtraction and backward counting variations were not alcohol-sensitive enough for use as FSTs. Three tests showed significant promise as on-boat FST and were identified as the finger to nose, 30-second time estimation and the skip alphabet. As a note, horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) was also evaluated in the marine environment, but because it is neural and not vestibular in origin (vestibular impairment may include dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, nausea, and fuzzy vision), there were no perceived issues in its use as an on-boat FST. Recently, HGN was validated for both sitting and prone positions, thus increasing its validity as an on-boat predictor of alcohol use in the marine environment.</p><p><br>In 2011, after a three-year study funded by the Coast Guard, NASBLA – along with the SCRI – validated four seated field sobriety tests for use afloat. Four seated tests have been approved for detection of impairment (defined as BAC greater than or equal to .08%: <i>horizontal gaze nystagmus; finger to nose; palm pat, and hand coordination.</i> </p><p><br>“<i>Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus</i> – The HGN test requires three separate checks, administered independently to each eye. Four or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.</p><p><br><i>Finger to Nose</i> – The FTN test requires the subject to bring the tip of the index finger to touch the tip of the nose. It is performed with eyes closed and head tilted slightly back. Nine or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.</p><p><br><i>The Palm Pat</i> –<i> </i>The PP test requires the subjects to place one hand extended, palm up, out in front of them. The other hand is placed on top of the first with the palm facing down. The top hand rotates 180 degrees and pats the bottom hand, alternating between the back of the hand and the palm of the hand. The bottom hand remains stationary. The subjects count out loud in relation with each pat. Two or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%. </p><p><br><i>The Hand Count</i> – The HC test requires the subjects to perform a series of tasks with their hands. It is very loosely adapted from the Walk-And-Turn test performed on land. Three or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.”</p><p><br>Fiorentino, Dary D., <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.operationdrywater.org/documents/AAP-Validation-of-sobriety-tests-for-the-marine-environment-030511.pdf">“Validation of Sobriety Tests for the Marine Environment,”</a> <i>Accident Analysis and Prevention</i> November 2010.

If you receive a police report where the officer walks through the IC paperwork with your client then gets them to take the breath test, the client is entitled to suppression of the BAC results. <i>State v. Woodruff</i>, <i>supra</i>, makes this an express holding. <i>Id</i> at 487. </p><p><br>Even if you receive no IC paperwork in the police report, it is worth asking your client whether there were any threats or promises, express or veiled, made by the officer regarding adverse consequences of refusing a breath or blood test.

Bikes and Other Statutes</b></p><p><br><i>State v. Woodruff</i> lays the groundwork for the argument that if a statute refers to “vehicle,” it will apply to bicycles. See Reckless Driving <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors811.html">811.140</a>, “a person commits the offense of Reckless Driving if the person recklessly drives a <i>vehicle</i>...”(emphasis added). But if a statute refers to “motor vehicles,” the bicycles will not fall under the statute. See Implied Consent. </p><p><br>However, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Potter,+185+Or+App+81+%282002&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=11027246497969834870&amp;scilh=0">State v.

In <i>Potter</i> a bicyclist was convicted under 811.130 for impeding traffic. This particular statute states that “a person commits the offense of impeding traffic if the person drives a motor vehicle or a combination of motor vehicles in a manner that impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.”</p><p><br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s denial of the bicyclist’s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on the grounds that 811.130 did apply to bicycles, express reference to motor vehicles in the statute notwithstanding. In reaching this conclusion the court relied on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors801.html">801.026(6)</a> and 814.400. </p><p><br>801.026 lays out a list of exemptions and exceptions to the vehicle code. Subsection (6) addresses bicycles:</p><p>“6) Devices that are powered exclusively by human power are not subject to those provisions of the vehicle code that relate to vehicles. Notwithstanding this subsection, bicycles are generally subject to the vehicle code as provided under ORS 814.400.” <i>See </i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Smith,+184+Or+App+118+%282002%29&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=16003909448037687770&amp;scilh=0">State v.

BOLI</a> analysis, the court concludes that, since 801.026(6) exempts non-motorized vehicles from the Vehicle Code except for bicycles as provided in 814.400, the exception spelled out in 814.400(2)(that 814.400 does not apply when otherwise provided under the Vehicle Code) would be rendered meaningless were the court to find that 811.130 did not apply to bikes without the legislature specifically exempting bicycles from the coverage of 811.130. </p><p><br>In other words, according to <i>Potter</i>, non-motorized vehicles are exempted from the vehicle code under 801.026(6) except for bicycles. In general, bikes fall under the vehicle code by way of 814.400(1), unless according to 814.400(1)(b) “otherwise specifically provided under the vehicle code.” <i>Potter </i>seems to hold that bicycles always fall under all provisions of the vehicle code unless a particular statute specifically says it does not apply to bicycles. </p><p><br>There is great conflict between <i>Potter </i>and <i>Woodruff</i>. Under the <i>Potter </i>reasoning, implied consent should apply to bicycles because it does not specifically exempt bicycles. Extending <i>Potter </i>to implied consent would lead to an absurd result because no operator’s license is necessary to ride a bicycle in Oregon, thus the implicit consent to take a breath test one gives to the state when they receive a driver’s license simply doesn’t exist when it comes to bicycles. </p><p><br>Should this issue come up, another angle of attack is 814.400(1)(a), which provides that the vehicle code applies to bicycles except for “those provisions which by their very nature can have no application.” This subsection was not argued in <i>Potter</i>. Arguably, a provision in the code that refers specifically to motor vehicles cannot by its very nature apply to bicycles. Presumably, the legislature knows what it is doing when it uses the more specific language of “motor vehicle” versus simply “vehicle” in any given provision in the vehicle code. </p><p><br>Permanent revocation of driving privileges of person convicted of felony while driving under influence of intoxicants or of multiple driving under influence of intoxicants offenses applies to person convicted of felony or offenses while operating bicycle under influence of intoxicants. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Abbey,+239+Or+App+306,+245+p3d+152+%282010%29&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=5701807464496455423&amp;scilh=0">State v.

Other Defenses</b></p><p><br><b>A. Sidewalk vs. Street</b></p><p><br>Was your client riding his bike on the sidewalk as opposed to in the street? The vehicle code only applies to those areas that are “premises open to the public.” Under 801.400, “premises open to the public” includes any premises open to the general public for the use of motor vehicles, whether the premises are publicly or privately owned and whether or not a fee is charged for the use of the premises. [1983 c.338 §§72]</p><p><br>A sidewalk is not open for the use of motor vehicles; the code does not apply in that situation. </p><p><br><b>B. Balance</b></p><p><br>How was you client doing on his bike before he got pulled over? Riding a bicycle requires not only a fair amount of physical coordination, but balance as well. It really is a test of divided attention and balance. Were they riding along just fine prior to being stopped for not having a light on their bike?</p><p><br><b>V.
